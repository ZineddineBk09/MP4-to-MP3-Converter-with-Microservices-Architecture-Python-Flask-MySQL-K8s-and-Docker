# MP4 to MP3 Converter with Python, Flask, MySQL, K8s, and Docker

(hey copilot, please help me write a good README.md file for this project. I want to make sure that I cover all the important aspects of the project, such as the technologies used, the architecture, the deployment, and the setup. I also want to make sure that the README.md file is well-organized and easy to read. also it's important to use emojis for fun.Thanks!)

## Introduction 📝

This is a simple MP4 to MP3 converter using Python, Flask, MySQL, K8s, and Docker. The application is a simple web application that allows users to upload an MP4 file and convert it to an MP3 file. The application will be based on a **Microservices Architecture** and will be deployed on **Kubernetes**.

## Technologies 🛠️

- Python
- Flask
- MySQL
- K8s
- Docker

## Development Environment 🛠️

- Ubuntu 22.04
- Python 3.10.12
- Flask 3.0.2
- MySQL 8.0.36
- K8s 1.22.2

## Architecture 🏗️

The application will be based on a **Microservices Architecture**. The application will consist of the following services:

- **Frontend Service**: This service will be responsible for handling the user interface. It will be a simple web application that allows users to upload an MP4 file and convert it to an MP3 file.
- **API Gateway**: This is the entry point for the system. It will be responsible for routing requests to the appropriate services.
- **Auth service**: This service will be responsible for handling user authentication and authorization.
- **Auth DB**: This service will be responsible for storing user information.
- **Queue Service**: This service will use RabbitMQ to store messages that need to be processed by the system.
- **Storage DB**: This service will be responsible for storing the MP4 and MP3 files.
- **Video to mp3 service**: This service will be responsible for converting the MP4 file to an MP3 audio file.
- **Notification service**: This service will be responsible for sending notifications to users.
- **K8s**: All the above services will be deployed on a **Kubernetes** cluster.

## Deployment 🚀

The application will be deployed on **Kubernetes**. The application will be deployed as a set of **Docker** containers, with each service running in its own container. The application will be deployed on a **Kubernetes** cluster, with each service running as a **Kubernetes** deployment.

## Setup 🛠️

The first step is to install the required dependencies. The application requires the following dependencies:

> ### Python 🐍
>
> - Flask: `pip install flask`
> - Flask-MySQL: `pip install flask-mysql`
> - Flask-Uploads: `pip install flask-uploads`
>
> ### MySQL 🐬
>
> - MySQL: `sudo apt-get install mysql-server` `https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-22-04`
> - Run the following commands to create the database, user, and the users table:
>   `mysql -uroot < init.sql`
>
> ### RabbitMQ 🐰
>
> - RabbitMQ: `sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server`
>
> ### K8s 🚢
>
> - Minikube: `https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/`
> - K9s: `https://github.com/derailed/k9s`
>
> ### Docker 🐳
>
> - Docker: `https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/`

The next step is to clone the repository and build the Docker images for the services. The repository contains a `Dockerfile` for each service, which can be used to build the Docker images. The `Dockerfile` for each service is located in the root directory of the repository.

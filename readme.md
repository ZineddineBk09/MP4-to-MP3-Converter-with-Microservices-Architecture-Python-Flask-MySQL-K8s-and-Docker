# MP4 to MP3 Converter with Python, Flask, MySQL, K8s, and Docker
(hey copilot, please help me write a good README.md file for this project. I want to make sure that I cover all the important aspects of the project, such as the technologies used, the architecture, the deployment, and the setup. I also want to make sure that the README.md file is well-organized and easy to read. also it's important to use emojis for fun.Thanks!)

## Introduction 🚀
This is a simple MP4 to MP3 converter using Python, Flask, MySQL, K8s, and Docker. The application is a simple web application that allows users to upload an MP4 file and convert it to an MP3 file. The application will be based on a **Microservices Architecture** and will be deployed on **Kubernetes**.

## Technologies 🛠️
- Python
- Flask
- MySQL
- K8s
- Docker

## Development Environment 🛠️
- Ubuntu 22.04
- Python 3.10.12
- Flask 3.0.2
- MySQL 8.0.36
- K8s 1.22.2


## Architecture 🏗️
The application will be based on a **Microservices Architecture**. The application will consist of the following services:
- **Frontend Service**: This service will be responsible for handling the user interface. It will be a simple web application that allows users to upload an MP4 file and convert it to an MP3 file.
- **Conversion Service**: This service will be responsible for converting the MP4 file to an MP3 file. It will be a simple Python script that uses the `moviepy` library to perform the conversion.
- **Database Service**: This service will be responsible for storing the MP4 and MP3 files. It will be a MySQL database that stores the files in a table.
- **RabbitMQ Service**: This service will be responsible for handling the communication between the services. It will be a simple RabbitMQ message broker that allows the services to communicate with each other.

## Deployment 🚀
The application will be deployed on **Kubernetes**. The application will be deployed as a set of **Docker** containers, with each service running in its own container. The application will be deployed on a **Kubernetes** cluster, with each service running as a **Kubernetes** deployment.

## Setup 🛠️
The first step is to install the required dependencies. The application requires the following dependencies:
>### Python 🐍
>
> - Flask: `pip install flask`
> - Flask-MySQL: `pip install flask-mysql`
> - Flask-Uploads: `pip install flask-uploads`
>
>### MySQL 🐬
>
> - MySQL: `sudo apt-get install mysql-server` `https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-22-04`
>
>### RabbitMQ 🐰
>
> - RabbitMQ: `sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server`
>
>### K8s 🚢
>
> - Minikube: `https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/`
> - K9s: `https://github.com/derailed/k9s`
>
>### Docker 🐳
>
> - Docker: `https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/`
>

The next step is to clone the repository and build the Docker images for the services. The repository contains a `Dockerfile` for each service, which can be used to build the Docker images. The `Dockerfile` for each service is located in the root directory of the repository.

## Conclusion 🎉
This is a simple MP4 to MP3 converter using Python, Flask, MySQL, K8s, and Docker. The application is a simple web application that allows users to upload an MP4 file and convert it to an MP3 file. The application is based on a **Microservices Architecture** and is deployed on **Kubernetes**.
